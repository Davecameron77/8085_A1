       "347   dinner review\\n\\ni rarely write reviews but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences ive ever had it was objectively a horrible experience even without comparing it to the hype it receives and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration \\n\\nwe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance short wait but not too bad keep in mind it seemed like a normal friday night but werent super busy or atcapacity\\n\\nit was a birthday dinner so i told the hostesses that it was her birthday and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal which was acknowledged pretty standard stuff whether at a applebees or the french laundry we were sat at a booth right next to the maitre d stand and next to all the wait staffs home base so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention \\n\\nafter getting us waters it took them a long time to even come by and acknowledge us after ordering wine it took them another good 1520 minutes to even bring us our wine and no one even checked in on us hint if youre running a restaurant wine is your profit center and doesnt take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it bring it out asap \\n\\nafter ordering food it was more of the samea long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us at all we drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order a couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal \\n\\nonce our meal was done and taken away we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 1015 minutes again after coming back he asked what dessert we wanted so we ordered some coffees and waited and waited eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times \\n\\nthey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle\\n\\nin summary the food was pretty hit or miss pretty mediocre for this price point whipped feta like other reviews have said was amazing and the braised lamb was really good but the sirloin was chewy and bland and the grilled caesar tasted like a soggy lukewarm wilted mess two orders were left untouched by a group of 8 atmosphere was nice and trendy but the service which is a huge reason to spend your hardearned  at a restaurant was absolutely horrendous \\n\\ni really love going to cool popular restaurants and having a great time and i hate writing such a negative review but i had to share my experience especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of undeserved hype   \n",

       "347   dinner review\\n\\ni rarely write reviews but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences ive ever had it was objectively a horrible experience even without comparing it to the hype it receives and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration \\n\\nwe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance short wait but not too bad keep in mind it seemed like a normal friday night but werent super busy or atcapacity\\n\\nit was a birthday dinner so i told the hostesses that it was her birthday and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal which was acknowledged pretty standard stuff whether at a applebees or the french laundry we were sat at a booth right next to the maitre d stand and next to all the wait staffs home base so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention \\n\\nafter getting us waters it took them a long time to even come by and acknowledge us after ordering wine it took them another good 1520 minutes to even bring us our wine and no one even checked in on us hint if youre running a restaurant wine is your profit center and doesnt take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it bring it out asap \\n\\nafter ordering food it was more of the samea long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us at all we drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order a couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal \\n\\nonce our meal was done and taken away we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 1015 minutes again after coming back he asked what dessert we wanted so we ordered some coffees and waited and waited eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times \\n\\nthey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle\\n\\nin summary the food was pretty hit or miss pretty mediocre for this price point whipped feta like other reviews have said was amazing and the braised lamb was really good but the sirloin was chewy and bland and the grilled caesar tasted like a soggy lukewarm wilted mess two orders were left untouched by a group of 8 atmosphere was nice and trendy but the service which is a huge reason to spend your hardearned  at a restaurant was absolutely horrendous \\n\\ni really love going to cool popular restaurants and having a great time and i hate writing such a negative review but i had to share my experience especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of undeserved hype   \n",
